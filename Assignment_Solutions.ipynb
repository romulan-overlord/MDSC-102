    "The expectation of a random variable is also known as its mean or average. For a binomial random variable X, which follows a binomial distribution, we'll first need to know the parameters of the distribution: the number of trials (n) and the probability of success (p).\n",

    "The probability mass function (PMF) of a binomial distribution is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1 - p)^(n - k)\n",

    "where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, equal to n! / (k! * (n - k)!), and k is the number of successful outcomes.\n",

    "\n",

    "The first term is related to the second moment of X, and the second term is related to the first moment of X. The second term can be directly computed as E[X].\n",

    "The first term, Σ [k^2 * P(X = k)], involves the sum of k^2 multiplied by the probability of X being equal to k. This can be a bit more complex to calculate directly, but it can also be expressed in terms of the variance of X (Var(X)) and the mean of X (E[X]) using the formula:\n",
